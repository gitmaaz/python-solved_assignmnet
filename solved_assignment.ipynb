    "Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS1. \n",
    "Sure, let's dive into the world of tuples in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are a type of data structure that hold an ordered collection of elements. They are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses `( )`. Here are some key characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordered**: Tuples maintain a left-to-right positional ordering among the items they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified. This means you can't add, remove, or change elements. This immutability can be handy when you need a constant set of values and you want to ensure that they do not get changed accidentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Allow Duplicates**: Tuples allow duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indexable**: Tuples are indexed and the indexing starts from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterable**: Tuples are iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Can Contain Multiple Data Types**: Like lists, tuples can contain different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's a simple example of a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')\n",
    "print(my_tuple)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, once you've defined your tuple, you can't change its structure or the elements inside it. It's as constant as the North Star!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why\n",
    "tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS2.Tuples in Python have two built-in methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **count()**: This method returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "2. **index()**: This method finds the first occurrence of a specified value in the tuple and returns its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a memorable example for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Let's create a tuple of fruits\n",
    "fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple', 'cherry')\n",
    "\n",
    "# count() method\n",
    "apple_count = fruits.count('apple')\n",
    "print(f\"The apple appears {apple_count} times in the fruit tuple.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# index() method\n",
    "cherry_index = fruits.index('cherry')\n",
    "print(f\"The cherry first appears at position {cherry_index} in the fruit tuple.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "The apple appears 2 times in the fruit tuple.\n",
    "The cherry first appears at position 2 in the fruit tuple.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why do tuples have only two methods compared to lists? The answer lies in their immutability. Tuples are immutable, meaning they can't be changed after they're created. This is why they don't have methods like `append()`, `remove()`, or `insert()`, which you'll find in lists. This immutability makes tuples simpler and more efficient in terms of memory and performance compared to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, in the world of Python, tuples are like the reliable old friends who never change!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Which collection datatypes in python do not allow duplicate items? Write a code using a set to remove\n",
    "duplicates from the given list.\n",
    "List = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS3.\n",
    "In Python, the collection data types that do not allow duplicate items are **sets** and **dictionaries**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. It's defined by values separated by comma inside braces `{ }`. Here's how you can use a set to remove duplicates from your list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Given list\n",
    "List = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a set from the list, which will remove duplicates\n",
    "unique_set = set(List)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the set back to a list\n",
    "unique_list = list(unique_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(unique_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, when you're lost in a sea of duplicates, a set is your lighthouse!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the difference between the union() and update() methods for a set. Give an example of\n",
    "each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans4.Sure, let's explore the `union()` and `update()` methods in Python sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **union()**: The `union()` method returns a new set with all items from both sets. The original sets are not modified. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define two sets\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the union() method\n",
    "set3 = set1.union(set2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(set3)  # Outputs: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **update()**: The `update()` method adds items from one set to another, effectively performing the union operation and updating the original set. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define two sets\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the update() method\n",
    "set1.update(set2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(set1)  # Outputs: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between the two methods is that `union()` does not modify the original sets, while `update()` does. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, `union()` is like a polite guest who doesn't disturb the host, while `update()` is like a lively friend who makes changes to your home! \n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is a dictionary? Give an example. Also, state whether a dictionary is ordered or unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS5.A **dictionary** in Python is a mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. Dictionaries are defined by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`. A colon `:` separates each key from its associated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 20,\n",
    "    \"courses\": [\"Math\", \"Science\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(student)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "{'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 20, 'courses': ['Math', 'Science']}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dictionary, `\"name\"`, `\"age\"`, and `\"courses\"` are keys, and `\"John Doe\"`, `20`, and `[\"Math\", \"Science\"]` are their respective values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered. However, the order is not meant to be relied upon, and it's best to think of dictionaries as inherently unordered collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a dictionary is like a mini-database, storing related pieces of information together! \n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Can we create a nested dictionary? If so, please give an example by creating a simple one-level\n",
    "nested dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS6.Yes, we can create a nested dictionary in Python. A nested dictionary is a dictionary within a dictionary. It's a collection of dictionaries into one single dictionary. Here's an example of a simple one-level nested dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a nested dictionary\n",
    "nested_dict = {\n",
    "    \"dictA\": {\n",
    "        \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n",
    "        \"key_2\": \"value_2\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"dictB\": {\n",
    "        \"key_3\": \"value_3\",\n",
    "        \"key_4\": \"value_4\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the nested dictionary\n",
    "print(nested_dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'dictA': {'key_1': 'value_1', 'key_2': 'value_2'},\n",
    "    'dictB': {'key_3': 'value_3', 'key_4': 'value_4'}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `dictA` and `dictB` are dictionaries themselves, thus creating a dictionary of dictionaries, also known as a nested dictionary. This is a simple yet powerful concept that allows you to store complex, multi-level data structures in Python. Remember, the keys in a dictionary must be unique and can be of any immutable type (like strings, numbers, or tuples), while the values can be of any type. This flexibility makes nested dictionaries a widely used data structure in Python. I hope this example helps you remember the concept of nested dictionaries throughout your life! Happy coding! \n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Using setdefault() method, create key named topics in the given dictionary and also add the value of\n",
    "the key as this list ['Python', 'Machine Learningâ€™, 'Deep Learning']\n",
    "dict1 = {'language' : 'Python', 'course': 'Data Science Masters'}\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS7.Sure, you can use the `setdefault()` method to add a key to a dictionary if it does not already exist. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Given dictionary\n",
    "dict1 = {'language' : 'Python', 'course': 'Data Science Masters'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# List to be added as value for the new key\n",
    "topics_list = ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using setdefault() method to add a new key-value pair\n",
    "dict1.setdefault('topics', topics_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dict1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'language': 'Python',\n",
    "    'course': 'Data Science Masters',\n",
    "    'topics': ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `setdefault()` checks if 'topics' is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, the method returns the value of 'topics'. If it is not, the method adds 'topics' to the dictionary with the provided value and then returns that value. This is a handy method when you want to avoid key errors and ensure that your key-value pair is added only if the key does not exist in the dictionary. Happy coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What are the three view objects in dictionaries? Use the three in-built methods in python to display\n",
    "these three view objects for the given dictionary.\n",
    "dict1 = {'Sport': 'Cricket' , 'Teams': ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand']}\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS8.\n",
    "In Python, dictionaries have three view objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keys**: This view displays all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "2. **Values**: This view shows all the values associated with the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "3. **Items**: This view presents all the key-value pairs in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access these views using the `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` methods respectively. Here's how you can use these methods with your given dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Given dictionary\n",
    "dict1 = {'Sport': 'Cricket' , 'Teams': ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand']}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Displaying keys using keys() method\n",
    "print(\"Keys: \", dict1.keys())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Displaying values using values() method\n",
    "print(\"Values: \", dict1.values())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Displaying key-value pairs using items() method\n",
    "print(\"Items: \", dict1.items())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Keys:  dict_keys(['Sport', 'Teams'])\n",
    "Values:  dict_values(['Cricket', ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand']])\n",
    "Items:  dict_items([('Sport', 'Cricket'), ('Teams', ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand'])])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods return view objects which are dynamic views on the dictionaryâ€™s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. Happy coding! \n"
